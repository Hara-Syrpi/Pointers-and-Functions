# Pointers-and-Functions
In this program, we create two functions. First function's name is swap and second function's name is swap_no_pointers.
Both functions, accept two integers and swap their values.
Subsequently, we initialize two integers, num1 = 100 and num2 = 200 and then call the functions.
